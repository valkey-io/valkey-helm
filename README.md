A lightweight Helm chart for deploying Valkey (a Redis alternative) to Kubernetes.

---

## TL;DR

```bash
helm repo add valkey https://valkey.io/valkey-helm/
helm install valkey valkey/valkey
```

---

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Valkey](https://valkey.io) deployment using the Helm package manager.

---
## Deployment Options

### Standalone Mode
The chart deploys Valkey in standalone mode.

### Cluster Mode
To deploy Valkey in cluster mode for availability and scalability, use the following options:

#### Using Local Chart Files
To deploy the cluster mode using the local chart files:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory containing the chart
cd fork_valkey_helm/valkey-helm

# Install the chart from local files
helm install valkey-cluster ./valkey-cluster
```

#### Configuration
You can customize the installation by providing values:

```bash
helm install valkey-cluster ./valkey-cluster --values my-values.yaml
```

Cluster mode features:
- Automatic deployment of 3 master nodes and 3 replica nodes (minimum 6 nodes)
- Master-replica replication for data redundancy
- Automatic failover if a master node becomes unavailable
- Data sharding across multiple master nodes
